## Why This Matters

RAG solved a fundamental problem with language models: **they can't access updated information or cite sources**. By combining neural retrieval with generation, RAG:

- **Grounds responses in facts:** Retrieves relevant documents before generating
- **Updates knowledge without retraining:** Just update the document database
- **Enables citations:** Can point to source documents
- **Reduces hallucinations:** Generates from retrieved evidence

**Real-world impact:**
- Powers ChatGPT plugins, Bing Chat, Perplexity AI
- Enables enterprise AI with private knowledge bases
- Standard pattern for production LLM applications
- Foundation for question answering, summarization, fact-checking

RAG made LLMs practical for knowledge-intensive real-world applications.

## The Problem

**Limitations of pure language models (2020):**

1. **Static knowledge**
   - Knowledge frozen at training time
   - Can't access new information
   - Requires retraining to update

2. **Hallucination**
   - Generate plausible but false information
   - No grounding in verifiable sources
   - Confident-sounding mistakes

3. **No attribution**
   - Can't cite sources
   - Difficult to verify claims
   - Low trust in critical applications

4. **Limited memory**
   - All knowledge must fit in parameters
   - Struggles with rare facts
   - Poor at long-tail knowledge

**The question:** Can we give language models access to external knowledge dynamically?

## Core Innovation

### Retrieval + Generation = RAG

**The key insight:** Treat generation as a two-stage process:

1. **Retrieve:** Find relevant documents from a large corpus
2. **Generate:** Condition language model on retrieved documents

**Architecture:**
```
Input Question
     ↓
Retrieve (top-k documents from knowledge base)
     ↓
Concatenate: [question + retrieved docs]
     ↓
Generate (using seq2seq model)
     ↓
Output Answer
```

### Two RAG Variants

**RAG-Sequence:**
- Retrieve once for entire sequence
- Use same documents for all tokens
- Simpler, faster

**RAG-Token:**
- Can retrieve different docs for each token
- Marginalize over retrieved docs per token
- More flexible, slower

---

## Architecture Details

### Components

**1. Retriever: Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR)**
- Bi-encoder architecture
- Query encoder: BERT_Q
- Document encoder: BERT_D

**Retrieval process:**
```python
# Encode query
q = BERT_Q(question)

# Encode all documents (pre-computed)
d_i = BERT_D(doc_i) for all docs

# Find top-k by dot product similarity
scores = q · d_i
top_k = argsort(scores)[-k:]
```

**2. Generator: BART**
- Pre-trained seq2seq model (BART-large)
- 400M parameters
- Fine-tuned on task with retrieved context

**3. Knowledge Source**
- Wikipedia (21M passages of 100 words)
- Pre-indexed with document embeddings
- Can swap for domain-specific corpus

### Training Approach

**End-to-end training:**
- Jointly train retriever and generator
- Retriever learns what to retrieve for generation
- Generator learns to use retrieved content

**Loss function:**
```
L = -log P(y | x, z)

Where:
  x = input question
  y = target answer
  z = retrieved documents
```

**Key trick:** Marginalize over top-k retrieved documents
```
P(y | x) = Σ_z P(z | x) P(y | x, z)

P(z | x) = softmax(query · doc)
P(y | x, z) = BART(y | x, z)
```

**Gradient flow:**
- Generator loss backprops through retriever
- Retriever learns to fetch documents that help generation
- Uses differentiable top-k approximation

---

## How It Works (Step-by-Step)

### Example: Question Answering

**Input:** "When was the first iPhone released?"

**Step 1: Encode query**
```
q_embed = BERT_Q("When was the first iPhone released?")
```

**Step 2: Retrieve top-k passages**
```
# Pre-computed document embeddings
doc_scores = q_embed · all_doc_embeddings

# Get top-5
top_docs = [
  "The iPhone was announced by Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007...",
  "Apple Inc. released the first generation iPhone on June 29, 2007...",
  "The original iPhone was marketed as combining three products...",
  ...
]
```

**Step 3: Generate answer**
```
# RAG-Sequence: Use all docs together
input = "Question: When was the first iPhone released?\n\n" +
        "Context: " + join(top_docs) + "\n\n" +
        "Answer:"

output = BART.generate(input)
# "June 29, 2007"
```

**Step 4: (Optional) Return sources**
```
# Can cite which documents were used
sources = [doc_urls[i] for i in top_k_indices]
```

## Experimental Results

### Tasks Tested

**Open-domain Question Answering:**
- Natural Questions
- TriviaQA
- WebQuestions
- CuratedTREC

**Performance (Exact Match accuracy):**

| Model | Natural Questions | TriviaQA | WebQuestions |
|-------|-------------------|----------|--------------|
| BART (no retrieval) | 24.0% | 35.0% | 28.0% |
| DPR + BART (pipeline) | 41.5% | 56.8% | 42.4% |
| **RAG-Token** | **44.5%** | **56.1%** | **45.2%** |
| **RAG-Sequence** | **44.1%** | **56.8%** | **45.5%** |

**Key finding:** RAG beats pipeline approach (retrieve then generate separately).

### Fact Verification (FEVER)

| Model | Accuracy |
|-------|----------|
| BERT baseline | 75.6% |
| **RAG-Sequence** | **78.1%** |

## Implementation Guide

### Basic RAG Pipeline

```python
from transformers import RagTokenizer, RagRetriever, RagTokenForGeneration

# Load RAG model
tokenizer = RagTokenizer.from_pretrained("facebook/rag-token-nq")
retriever = RagRetriever.from_pretrained(
    "facebook/rag-token-nq",
    index_name="exact",
    use_dummy_dataset=True  # Use real index for production
)
model = RagTokenForGeneration.from_pretrained(
    "facebook/rag-token-nq",
    retriever=retriever
)

# Question answering
question = "When was the first iPhone released?"
inputs = tokenizer(question, return_tensors="pt")

# Generate (retrieval happens inside)
generated = model.generate(**inputs)
answer = tokenizer.decode(generated[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

print(answer)  # "June 29, 2007"

# Access retrieved documents
retrieved_docs = retriever(inputs["input_ids"], n_docs=5)
for doc in retrieved_docs:
    print(doc["title"], doc["text"][:100])
```

### Custom RAG with LangChain

```python
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA

# Build knowledge base
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(documents, embeddings)

# Create RAG chain
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=OpenAI(),
    retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 5}),
    return_source_documents=True
)

# Query
result = qa_chain({"query": "When was the first iPhone released?"})
print(result["result"])
print(result["source_documents"])
```

### Key Hyperparameters

**Retrieval:**
- `k`: Number of documents to retrieve (typically 5-10)
- `similarity_metric`: dot product, cosine, L2
- `index_type`: exact, HNSW, IVF (for large scale)

**Generation:**
